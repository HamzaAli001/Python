print("Hello World.....!")


# Example using sep and end in print()
# Define variables
name = "Alice"
age = 30
city = "Wonderland"
# Print with custom separator and end character
print("Name:", name, "Age:", age, "City:", city, sep=" | ", end=" - End of Info\n")
# Output  Name: | Alice | Age: | 30 | City: | Wonderland - End of Info


# By default, the print() function in Python uses a space as the separator (sep)
# between values and a newline character (end="\n") at the end of each printed line.
